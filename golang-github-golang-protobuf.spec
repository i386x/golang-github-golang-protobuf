# If any of the following macros should be set otherwise,
# you can wrap any of them with the following conditions:
# - %%if 0%%{centos} == 7
# - %%if 0%%{?rhel} == 7
# - %%if 0%%{?fedora} == 23
# Or just test for particular distribution:
# - %%if 0%%{centos}
# - %%if 0%%{?rhel}
# - %%if 0%%{?fedora}
#
# Be aware, on centos, both %%rhel and %%centos are set. If you want to test
# rhel specific macros, you can use %%if 0%%{?rhel} && 0%%{?centos} == 0 condition.
# (Don't forget to replace double percentage symbol with single one in order to apply a condition)
